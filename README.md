A game with numbers and cookies


This is a simple and elegant game: you are given a set of 9 random numbers, and you are asked to select all the numbers from this set which happen to be a multiple of another random number. After selecting all the correct multiples, press done to check your answer. If you select the numbers correctly, YOU GET A COOKIE! Else, YOU LOSE A COOKIE. Therefore, it is in your best interest to channel your mathematical talent and love for cookies on this arduous test of mental, physical and intestinal fortitude. Watch out though; every now and then, no numbers in the set of 9 may be a multiple of your given number! Good luck!
